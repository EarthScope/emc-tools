 DESCRIPTION:

 EMC Tools contains a set of Python scripts for working with EMC's netCDF Earth model files (netCDF 3 & 4 CLASSIC formats):
    - netCDF_2_GeoCSV.py - a Python script to convert a 2D or 3D netCDF Earth model file to GeoCSV format.
    - GeoCSV_2_netCDF.py - a Python script to convert a 2D or 3D 3D GeoCSV Earth model file to netCDF format.
    - emc-inspector.py   - a Python script to check a given netCDF file against the EMC requirements and 
                           flags any missing or incorrectly defined attributes. The check is not exhaustive, and visual validation is required 
                           to identify any additional errors.

 Above scripts support models with projected coordinate systems as auxiliary coordinates:

 REQUIREMENTS:
    - Python: These scripts were created and tested under:

        Mac:
            python version : 3.12.0
            conda version : 23.11.0
            System Version:	macOS 14.61.1 

         Packages required:
            netCDF4 Python library
            numpy

 BUNDLE INSTALLATION:
    - The scripts are independent and no installation is required. An optional "data" directory with relative path:
      "../data/" with respect to the script directory may be used to store and work with model files.

      NOTE: These scripts will NOT create directories

      INSTALLATION STEPS:

      Clone the Repository

      Set Up a Virtual Environment:

      python3 -m venv env
