 DESCRIPTION:

 EMC Tools contains a set of Python scripts for working with EMC's netCDF Earth model files (netCDF 3 format):
    - netCDF_2_GeoCSV.py - a Python script to convert a 2D or 3D netCDF Earth model file to GeoCSV format.
    - GeoCSV_2_netCDF.py - a Python script to convert a 2D or 3D 3D GeoCSV Earth model file to netCDF format.
 Both scripts support models with projected coordinate systems:

            netCDF4 Python library
            numpy

 BUNDLE INSTALLATION:
    - The scripts are independent and no installation is required. An optional "data" directory with relative path:
      "../data/" with respect to the script directory may be used to store and work with model files.

      NOTE: These scripts will NOT create directories
